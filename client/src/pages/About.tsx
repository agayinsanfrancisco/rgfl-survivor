        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>
          We&apos;re a small crew of Survivor superfans who have run a rules-heavy fantasy league for over a decade.
          Our backgrounds span software development, game design, and of course untold hours analyzing Survivor strategy.
          We wanted to share the experience with the broader community â€” the spreadsheets, the heated debates, the
          late-night power rankings.

        <h2>Monetization</h2>
        <p>
          Survivor Fantasy League is free to play and does not offer cash payouts. We keep the lights on with minimal,
          tasteful ads that help pay for hosting and ongoing development so the league can evolve season after season.
