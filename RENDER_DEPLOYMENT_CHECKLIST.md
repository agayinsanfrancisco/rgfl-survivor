## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Database on Render ✅

  - Name: `rgfl-db`
  - Plan: Free
  - Database Name: `rgfl_db`
  - User: `rgfl_user`

### Step 2: Deploy Web Service ✅
- [x] Connect your GitHub repository
- [x] Create new Web Service:
  - **Name**: `rgfl-survivor`
  - **Environment**: Node
  - **Plan**: Free
  - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build && npx prisma migrate deploy`
  - **Start Command**: `npm start`
  - **Health Check Path**: `/`

### Step 3: Environment Variables ✅
- [x] Set these in your Render service:
  - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
  - `DATABASE_URL`: (Auto-generated from database)
  - `SESSION_SECRET`: (Generate secure random string)
  - `PORT`: `5050`

### Step 4: Deploy ✅
- [x] Click "Deploy" on your service
- [x] Monitor build logs for any issues
- [x] Check health check endpoint

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Methods

### Manual Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload `dist` folder to your server
3. Set environment variables
4. Run `npm start`

## 📋 Post-Deployment Verification ✅

### Check These Endpoints
- [x] `/` - Should serve React app
- [x] `/api/auth/login` - Should handle authentication
- [x] `/api/castaways` - Should return castaway data
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] Static files serving correctly

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Build fails**: Check all dependencies in package.json
2. **Database connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL is set
3. **Static files not serving**: Ensure build completed successfully
4. **CORS issues**: Check FRONTEND_URL environment variable
